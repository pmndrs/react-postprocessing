## Publishing

We use `semantic-release` to deploy the package. Because of this only certain commits will trigger the action of creating a release:

- `fix:` will create a `0.0.x` version
- `feat:` will create a `0.x.0` version
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` will create a `x.0.0` version

We release on `master` branch. Any other commits will not fire a release.
