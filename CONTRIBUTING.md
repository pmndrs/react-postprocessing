## Storybook

If you're adding a brand new feature, you need to make sure you add a storybook entry, here's a few tips:

- Keep the story simple & show the essence of the component, remember some people may be looking at using drei for the first time & it's important the stories are clear and concise.
- Keep assets minimal (3D Models, textures) to avoid bloating the repository
- If you think a more involved example is necessary, you can always add a codesandbox to the main README while keeping the story minimalistic

## Publishing

We use `semantic-release` to deploy the package. Because of this only certain commits will trigger the action of creating a release:

- `fix:` will create a `0.0.x` version
- `feat:` will create a `0.x.0` version
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` will create a `x.0.0` version

We release on `master` branch. Any other commits will not fire a release.
