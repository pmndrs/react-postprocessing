`react-postprocessing` is a
[postprocessing](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing) wrapper for
[@react-three/fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). This is not
(yet) meant for complex orchestration of effects, but can save you
[hundreds of LOC](https://twitter.com/0xca0a/status/1289501594698960897) for a
straight forward effects-chain.

```bash
npm install @react-three/postprocessing
```

#### Why postprocessing and not three/examples/jsm/postprocessing?

From
[https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing#performance)

> This library provides an EffectPass which automatically organizes and merges
> any given combination of effects. This minimizes the amount of render
> operations and makes it possible to combine many effects without the
> performance penalties of traditional pass chaining. Additionally, every effect
> can choose its own blend function.
>
> All fullscreen render operations also use a single triangle that fills the
> screen. Compared to using a quad, this approach harmonizes with modern GPU
> rasterization patterns and eliminates unnecessary fragment calculations along
> the screen diagonal. This is especially beneficial for GPGPU passes and
> effects that use complex fragment shaders.

Postprocessing also supports srgb-encoding out of the box, as well as WebGL2
MSAA (multi sample anti aliasing), which is react-postprocessing's default, you
get high performance crisp results w/o jagged edges.

#### What does it look like?

Here's an example combining a couple of effects
([live demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-postprocessing-dof-blob-pqrpl?)).

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Bloom, DepthOfField, EffectComposer, Noise, Vignette } from '@react-three/postprocessing'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'

function App() {
  return (
    <Canvas>
      {/* Your regular scene contents go here, like always ... */}
      <EffectComposer>
        <DepthOfField focusDistance={0} focalLength={0.02} bokehScale={2} height={480} />
        <Bloom luminanceThreshold={0} luminanceSmoothing={0.9} height={300} />
        <Noise opacity={0.02} />
        <Vignette eskil={false} offset={0.1} darkness={1.1} />
      </EffectComposer>
    </Canvas>
  )
}
```

## Documentation

#### EffectComposer

The EffectComposer must wrap all your effects. It will manage them for you.

```jsx
<EffectComposer
  enabled?: boolean
  children: JSX.Element | JSX.Element[]
  depthBuffer?: boolean
  disableNormalPass?: boolean
  stencilBuffer?: boolean
  autoClear?: boolean
  multisampling?: number
  frameBufferType?: TextureDataType
  /** For effects that support DepthDownsamplingPass */
  resolutionScale?: number
  renderPriority?: number
  camera?: THREE.Camera
  scene?: THREE.Scene
>
```

#### Selection/Select

Some effects, like Outline or SelectiveBloom can select specific objects. To manage this in a declarative scene with just references can be messy, especially when things have to be grouped. These two components take care of it:

```jsx
<Selection
  children: JSX.Element | JSX.Element[]
  enabled?: boolean
>

<Select
  children: JSX.Element | JSX.Element[]
  enabled?: boolean
>
```

You wrap everything into a selection, this one holds all the selections. Now you can individually select objects or groups. Effects that support selections (for instance `Outline`) will acknowledge it.

```jsx
<Selection>
  <EffectComposer autoclear={false}>
    <Outline blur edgeStrength={100} />
  </EffectComposer>
  <Select enabled>
    <mesh />
  </Select>
</Selection>
```

Selection can be nested and group multiple object, higher up selection take precence over lower ones. The following for instance will select everything. Remove the outmost `enabled` and only the two mesh group is selected. You can flip the selections or bind them to interactions and state.

```jsx
<Select enabled>
  <Select enabled>
    <mesh />
    <mesh />
  </Select>
  <Select>
    <mesh />
  </Select>
</Select>
```

#### Autofocus

<p>
  <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/dfw6w4"><img width="20%" src="https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/dfw6w4/thumbnail.png" alt="Autofocus demo"/></a>
</p>

An auto-focus effect, that extends `<DepthOfField>`.

```tsx
export type AutofocusProps = typeof DepthOfField & {
  target?: [number, number, number] // undefined
  mouse?: boolean // false
  debug?: number // undefined
  manual?: boolean // false
  smoothTime?: number // .25
}
```

```tsx
<EffectComposer>
  <Autofocus />
</EffectComposer>
```

Ref-api:

```tsx
type AutofocusApi = {
  dofRef: RefObject<DepthOfFieldEffect>
  hitpoint: THREE.Vector3
  update: (delta: number, updateTarget: boolean) => void
}
```

```tsx
<Autofocus ref={autofocusRef} />
```

Associated with `manual` prop, you can for example, animate the DOF target yourself:

```tsx
useFrame((_, delta) => {
  const api = autofocusRef.current
  api.update(delta, false) // update hitpoint only
  easing.damp3(api.dofRef.curent.target, api.hitpoint, 0.5, delta) // custom easing
})
```

#### Selective bloom

Bloom is selective by default, you control it not on the effect pass but on the materials by lifting their colors out of 0-1 range. a `luminanceThreshold` of 1 ensures that ootb nothing will glow, only the materials you pick. For this to work `toneMapped` has to be false on the materials, because it would otherwise clamp colors between 0 and 1 again.

```jsx
<Bloom mipmapBlur luminanceThreshold={1} />

// ‚ùå will not glow, same as RGB [1,0,0]
<meshStandardMaterial color="red"/>

// ‚úÖ will glow, same as RGB [2,0,0]
<meshStandardMaterial emissive="red" emissiveIntensity={2} toneMapped={false} />

// ‚ùå will not glow, same as RGB [1,0,0]
<meshBasicMaterial color="red" />

// ‚ùå will not glow, same as RGB [1,0,0], tone-mapping will clamp colors between 0 and 1
<meshBasicMaterial color={[2,0,0]} />

// ‚úÖ will glow, same as RGB [2,0,0]
<meshBasicMaterial color={[2,0,0]} toneMapped={false} />
```
