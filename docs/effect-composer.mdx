The `EffectComposer` must wrap all your effects. It will manage them for you.

```jsx
<EffectComposer
  enabled?: boolean
  depthBuffer?: boolean
  enableNormalPass?: boolean
  stencilBuffer?: boolean
  autoClear?: boolean
  multisampling?: number
  frameBufferType?: TextureDataType
  /** For effects that support DepthDownsamplingPass */
  resolutionScale?: number
  renderPriority?: number
  camera?: THREE.Camera
  scene?: THREE.Scene
>
{/* your effects go here */}
</EffectComposer>
```
